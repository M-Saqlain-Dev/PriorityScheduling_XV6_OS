**1. System Call Implementation:**

**1.1 Addition of report_statistics() System Call**
   - **Location:** `proc.c`, `syscall.c`, and related header files.
   - **Description:**  
     A new system call, `report_statistics()`, was developed. This call provides statistics and diagnostics about process execution.
   - **Purpose:**  
     To acquire data on process-related metrics useful for debugging, performance tuning, and system monitoring.

**2. Scheduler Enhancements:**

**2.1 Priority-Based Scheduling**
   - **Location:** `proc.c`, `syscall.h`, `syscall.c`, `sysproc.c`, `usys.S`, and `user.h`.
   - **Description:**  
     An enhancement was added to the scheduler to facilitate priority-based scheduling, ensuring that processes with higher priorities are scheduled before those with lower ones.
   - **Purpose:**  
     Enables critical tasks to be executed promptly, augmenting the system's overall efficiency and responsiveness.

**3. Error Handling and Diagnostics:**
   - **Location:** Various files, including `syscall.c` and `proc.c`.
   - **Description:**  
     Enhanced mechanisms were developed for error handling, making it easier to capture and report system anomalies.
   - **Purpose:**  
     Provides developers and users with clearer feedback, aiding in troubleshooting.
